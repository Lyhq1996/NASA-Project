# NASA-Project
• Developed a NASA launch system to enable scheduling, querying, and aborting launches to planets that may contain life.

• Followed MVC architecture to develop backend services in Node.js with Express and MongoDB Atlas.

• Worked with SpaceX API to map and persist launches to the database, reducing load by filtering out existing records.

• Connected APIs with a React frontend and tested API endpoints with JEST and SuperTest.

• Scaled the application with PM2 clusters to handle increased traffic loads and achieve zero downtime deployment.

• Containerized using Docker and set up a CI/CD pipeline through GitHub Actions for the automatic building, testing,
and deployment on AWS EC2.
